                    My web development journey started back in 2018 when I
                    bought my first Udemy course to learn some{" "}
                    <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and after that I got{" "}
                    <strong>an internship</strong> at a digital agency Isobar
                    Czech Republic, where I still work.

                    In almost 3 years at Isobar I learned countless things. From
                    centering the button to managing a smaller team. I'm
                    currently <strong>in charge of campaign assets</strong> such
                    as dynamic banners and newsletters. I also build websites in{" "}
                    <strong>Vue/Nuxt</strong> and maintenance legacy websites in
                    Laravel. Clients include Å KODA Auto, Sazka, Heineken, Sunar,
                    Generali and other brands.

                    But I feel it's <strong>time for a new challenge</strong>,
                    so I created this portfolio to{" "}
                    <strong>find a new job</strong>. In the evenings after work
                    I have been <strong>learning React</strong> and I would like
                    to continue in this direction. I want to build superb
                    websites using the newest technology.
